    <strong>I'm Stronger. I'm Smarter. I'm Better. I Am Better! - Homelander</strong><br>
    <em>I am italic.</em><br>
    <p>On June 2nd, 2022, season three, episode <strong>two</strong> of The Boys premiered on Amazon Prime, titled "The Only Man in the Sky."[1] In the ending scene of the episode, Starlight is onstage
     with Homelander (played by Antony Starr) to commemorate his birthday and a new project of hers. Then, an angry member of the crowd shouts out and condemns Homelander for his 
     relationship with Stormfront, prompting Homelander to retaliate by saying to the crowd, "I'm Stronger. I'm Smarter. I'm Better. I Am Better!" On June 2nd, the scene was uploaded
      to YouTube by the channel TVS Clips, earning roughly 1.1 million plays in three months (shown below).
